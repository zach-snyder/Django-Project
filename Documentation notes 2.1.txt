1.Install correct version of python from python.org. This documentation was done based on 3.11.4 on windows 11 using CMD as command line interface

python --version will display the version of python you are using

either in windows ui or in command line make a directory to store your virtual environment 

directory cs3300, inside is directory portfolio

cd to directory portfolio, create venv for django with: python -m venv djvenv
	there is now a djvenv directory in portfolio

to activate venv, run: djvenv\Scripts\activate.bat(ps1 if in powershell)

install django in venv: pip install Django==4.2 (for version 4.2)

it will prompt you to upgrade pip, run command given. mine was python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

start django project: django-admin startproject django_project

move contents of django_project(another django_project subdirectory and manage.py) to working directory, can remove original django_project dir

start server: python manage.py(or path to it, should now be in working dir) runserver

check if server up, internet browser: localhost:8000

this terminal now serves as a status terminal for the running server, need to open a new one to run commands on. 
	change directory, redo activation step new terminal window

make requirements file: pip freeze > filename.txt

To manage this project in VS Code, open new vs code window, open folder, navigate to portfolio folder and open that
